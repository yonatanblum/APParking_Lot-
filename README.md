As part of the "Integrative Engineering" course delivered by Eyal Eisenstein, my group and I have built "APParking_Lot" - A web server to manage an app whose purpose is to map the available parking and thereby create a social network that connects between the available parking to the parking seeker.  As part of the project, I created an app to illustrate the functionality built throughout the semester.

We used the following technologies:
A lot of Spring Framework technologies, MySQL, H2 Embedded, Hibernate, JUnit, POSTMAN, GIT, Rest API, Google Maps API, and more.
